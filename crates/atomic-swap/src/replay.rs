//! Cross-chain nonce replay protection (issue #238).
//!
//! A cross-chain transfer is authorised by a signature over one intent: *this
//! sender*, *this nonce*, *on this chain*, for *this payload*. Once a second
//! chain exists, a signature alone stops being enough, because the same bytes
//! can be presented twice in two different ways:
//!
//! * **Same chain, twice.** The relayer (or anyone who saw the envelope)
//!   submits the transfer again after it settled. The signature still verifies;
//!   without a nonce the recipient is paid twice.
//! * **A different chain.** A transfer signed for `testnet` is presented to
//!   `mainnet` — or to a fork of the same chain. If the digest does not name the
//!   chain, the verifier on the other side accepts it, and value moves that the
//!   signer never authorised.
//!
//! The two failure modes need different fixes, and this module implements both:
//!
//! 1. [`ReplayGuard::verify_and_record`] recomputes the intent digest with the
//!    *local* chain id and rejects a digest that was produced for another chain
//!    ([`ReplayError::ChainMismatch`]). The chain id is length-prefixed inside
//!    the digest, so `("ab", "c")` and `("a", "bc")` cannot collide.
//! 2. It then consumes the `(chain, sender, nonce)` triple exactly once. A
//!    second presentation of the same nonce is [`ReplayError::Replayed`].
//!
//! Tracking the nonce per domain is what makes the first fix usable: an
//! operator's nonce sequence on `mainnet` and on `testnet` are independent, so
//! a shared counter would reject legitimate traffic.
//!
//! # Replay windows, not a growing set
//!
//! A naive "seen nonces" set grows forever. Instead each domain keeps the
//! highest nonce it has accepted plus a 64-bit sliding window of the ones just
//! below it ([`NonceWindow`]). Nonces that fall out of the window are
//! [`ReplayError::StaleNonce`]: they cannot be distinguished from a replay, so
//! they are refused rather than accepted. A nonce far ahead of the window is
//! refused too, so one forged envelope cannot wedge the domain by pushing the
//! window past every nonce the sender will legitimately use next.
