//! Anomalous on-chain activity detection (issue #124).
//!
//! Static thresholds cannot see the attacks that matter most on a bridge or a
//! payment channel, because the attack is usually a *deviation from that
//! contract's own normal*, not a number above some fixed line. A contract doing
//! 40 invocations a minute that suddenly does 40 000 is being drained; a
//! contract that always does 40 000 is just busy. Handing both to Prometheus
//! leaves the honest one alarm-fatigued and the draining one unnoticed.
//!
//! This module adds the other half of the alerting: a baseline learned from the
//! metric's own recent history, and a robust score for how far the newest sample
//! sits from it. The same rules run in two places:
//!
//! * as Prometheus alert rules in `monitoring/alert-rules.yml`, for the live
//!   stack, and
//! * as `stellar-toolkit monitoring anomalies --input <samples.json>`, for CI
//!   and for replaying a sample window from the command line.
//!
//! Keeping one catalogue of rules in Rust means the check a pull request runs
//! and the rule that pages an operator agree on names, thresholds and severity.
//!
//! # Why the median and the MAD
//!
//! A mean and a standard deviation are the usual choice and they are the wrong
//! one here: both are dragged around by the very outliers being hunted, so one
//! large transfer inflates the deviation and hides the next nine. The median and
//! the median absolute deviation (MAD) have a breakdown point near 50%: up to
//! half the window can be garbage before the baseline moves.
//!
//! The score is the robust z:
//!
//! ```text
//! z = (observed - median) / (1.4826 * MAD)
//! ```
//!
//! # The flat-baseline trap
//!
//! On a perfectly flat baseline the MAD is zero, and every deviation would score
//! as infinitely anomalous — a series of `0, 0, 0, …, 0` would alert on a single
//! failure. The dispersion is therefore floored at
//! `max(min_dispersion, dispersion_ratio × |median|)`, so a metric that is
//! usually zero needs a *proportionally* large jump before it fires, and a
//! metric measured in stroops is scored against its own magnitude. Both the
//! floor and the ratio are configurable, and both are tested.
